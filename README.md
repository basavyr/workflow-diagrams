# workflow-diagrams

A collection of diagrams mainly related to Physics topics, such as Nuclear Structure, Quantum Mechanics, and more.

* Some diagrams with concepts from Computer Science are also available. 💻
* Content will be continously extended. ⚙️ 
* Any diagram will contain a final figure (e.g., a `.pdf` or `.png` file) and the original source file. 📄

## Development

The diagrams will be mostly created in [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/). This is a free browser interface which allows creation of complex diagrams and also export to different file formats.
